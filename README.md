In this project, I used a simple algorithm (Least Square Estimate) where I manually applied forward stewpise method to make recommendation system from the 10 Million Movie Lens dataset.  A more powerful algorithm such as matrix factorization and neighborhood models were impractical as they required immense computing power that a personal computer cannot provide (remember the dataset has 10 Million unique observations). While those complex algorithms are terrific, a simpler algorithm that can do the job is always preferred.
